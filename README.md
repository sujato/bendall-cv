# bendall-cv
Digitization of Oskar von Hinuber’s transcription of a fragment of the Pali Cullavagga

Here we gather all the relevant information and files for the project.

In his article, von Hinuber doesn’t give a name to the manuscript, usually just referring to it as “the Nepalese fragment”. But this is too vague, and a better name is wanted. Given that multiple manuscripts may emerge from Nepal or Kathmandu, I propose we name it after Clive Bendall, who brought this fragment to light in 1899. Thus it will be "Bendall CV" or bendall-cv.

The aim is to transcribe the fragment and make it available in a segmented plain text form that can be consumed by SuttaCentral and anyone else. The process is this:

1. Type the text twice.
2. Diff it, correct, and merge.
3. Diff it once more against SC’s Mahasangiti text.

Once we are satisfied with the accuracy of the transcription, we will make it available on SC, using a custom element that enables Pali/Pali comparison with diffing against MS displayed in the browser.

## Conventions

Generally for the initial transcription we will keep it the same as the Hinuber version, and will add proper markup later.

- `[]` restored text
- `()` partly destroyed text
- `<>` text cancelled by the scribe
- `<<>>` text omitted by the scribe
- `+` obscure akṣara
- `||`, `|` dandas as in the manuscript (use upright danda rather than slash as in Hinuber).
- `//` wrap line numbers in slash
- `{}` folio numbers (no need to add PTS vol/page numbers)
