Digitization of Oskar von Hinuber's transcription of a fragment of the Pali Culavagga

Here we gather all the relevant information and files for the project.

The aim is to transcribe the fragment and make it available in a segmented form that can be consumed by SuttaCentral and anyone else. The process is this:

1. Type the text twice.
2. Diff it, correct, and merge.
3. Diff it once more against SC's Mahasangiti text.

Once we are satisfied with the accuracy of the transcription, we will make it available on SC, using a custom element that enables Pali/Pali comparison with diffing displayed in the browser.
